              <p>
                My first passion was in the kitchen. I always loved bringing
                people together to share a meal so naturally I became a chef. I
                worked in some great restaurants over the years in London,
                Paris, and Los Angeles. While I loved the pace and the
                creativity of the kitchen, I found some of the most rewarding
                parts of the job were designing systems to optimize the
                production capabilities of the kitchen.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2015 I partenered with two French entrpreneurs to open one of
                the first barbecue restaurants in Paris. We were able to build a
                great team and create a unique dining experience for our guests
                and enjoyed rapid success and developed a loyal following in our
                neighborhood of Pigalle. I learned a lot about what it is to be
                a leader while working in this position and I am grateful not
                just to my former partners and colleagues, but to the entire
                city of Paris which I called home for nearly 8 years.
              </p>
              <p>
                In late 2019 I moved back to my hometown of Los Angeles with
                aspirations of opening a restaurant to share the experience of
                dining which is so special to me with my community.
                Unfortunately, the Covid pandemic shuttered the restaurant
                industry and I was left idle for the first time in my life. I
                decided to take this opportunity to finally pursue my passion
                for technology and began taking classes in computer science. I
                was instantly hooked.
              </p>
              <p>
                I found that I was able to apply the same principles of design
                and creativity that I had learned in the kitchen to the world of
                software development. I am now a full-time student at the
                University of Southern California where I am studying computer
                science and will be graduating with a B.S. and M.S. in the
                Spring of 2025. In the meantime, I will be throwing myself into
                the world of limitless possibility and learning everything I
                can.
