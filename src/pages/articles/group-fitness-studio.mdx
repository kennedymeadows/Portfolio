Group fitness studios create a difficult information ecosystem. For Alter Fitness Club, a unique solution was needed in order to deliver their modern approach to athletic conditioning.

To make this possible, we needed to build an application that could blend many different solutions for a single purpose. We needed to build a platform that could handle the following:

- A dynamic schedule that could be updated in real-time
- A booking system that could handle multiple classes at once
- A payment system that could handle multiple classes at once
- A membership system that could handle multiple classes at once

## Getting Started

Ruby on Rails is a web application framework that includes everything needed to create database-backed web applications according to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. Rails is a tool for building web applications, not for creating content or managing your database. It includes everything you need to build fantastic applications, but you get to choose how you build them.

We decided to build this application in Ruby on Rails because it was the quickest and easiest way for a one man operation to build the entire solution from scratch.
