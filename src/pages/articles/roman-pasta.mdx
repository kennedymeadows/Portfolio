There are four traditional Roman pastas, each one a study in perfection through simplicity.

I have had the pleasure of visiting Rome a number of times. Each time I attempt to try more and more restaurants, each with their own approach to these four dishes.

It really is quite incredible how much variation you can find in dishes which are composed of just a few ingredients. There is no one secret to making them great,
but there are certainly some commonalities. Likewise, there are various pitfalls which are often repeated, especially in such a tourist heavy city where getting customers to come back
can be of lower priority.

## Cacio E Pepe

Cacio e pepe is the most basic of the four. It is a dish of pasta, pecorino romano cheese and black pepper. The cheese is grated over the pasta and the pepper is ground over the top. The pasta is then tossed together and served.

Simple, right? Well, yes and no. The cheese and pepper are the two most important ingredients. The cheese should be of the highest quality, and the pepper should be freshly ground. The pasta should be cooked al dente, and the sauce should be light and creamy.

Achieving a light and creamy sauce means emulsifying the cheese and pepper with the pasta water. This is done by adding a small amount of pasta water to the cheese and pepper, and then adding more pasta water as the pasta is tossed.
The pasta water should be added slowly, and the sauce should be stirred constantly. The sauce should be light and creamy, but not watery.

Here's a recipe for Cacio e Pepe:

- 1 pound of pasta (I prefer bucatini and that's what you'll find in most restaurants in Rome)
- 1/2 cup of pecorino romano cheese
- 1/2 cup of freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 cup of pasta water

## Gricia

To make gricia, we simply need to add one more ingredient: guanciale. Guanciale is a cured pork cheek, and it is the most important ingredient in this dish.
It is the only ingredient which is not readily available in the US. Most restaurants in the US will substitute pancetta, which is a cured pork belly.
Personally, I think it's worth it to find a good source of guanciale. It is a very flavorful ingredient, and it is worth the effort to find a good source.

Making gricia is very similar to making cacio e pepe. The only difference is that we add the guanciale to the cheese and pepper, and we add a little bit of olive oil to the sauce.

Here's a recipe for Gricia:

- 1 pound of pasta
- 1/2 cup of pecorino romano cheese
- 1/2 cup of freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 cup of guanciale
- 1/2 cup of olive oil
- 1/2 cup of pasta water

## Carbonara

Carbonara is the most complex of the four. It is a dish of pasta, guanciale, pecorino romano cheese, black pepper, and eggs. The eggs are added to the sauce, and the sauce is then tossed with the pasta.

The eggs are the most important ingredient in this dish. They are what give the sauce its creaminess. The eggs should be added to the sauce slowly, and the sauce should be stirred constantly.

Many people think that carabonara is the best of the Roman pastas and it's widespread popularity and bastardization around the world is a testament to that. However, I think that it is the most difficult to get right.

Here's a recipe for Carbonara:

- 1 pound of pasta
- 1/2 cup of pecorino romano cheese
- 1/2 cup of freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 cup of guanciale
- 1/2 cup of olive oil
- 1/2 cup of pasta water
- 2 eggs

## Amatriciana

Amatriciana is my personal favorite of the Roman pastas. It is a dish of pasta, guanciale, pecorino romano cheese, black pepper, and tomatoes. The tomatoes are added to the sauce, and the sauce is then tossed with the pasta.

Getting the right tomatoes is the key to making a good amatriciana. The tomatoes should be very ripe, and they should be cooked down until they are very soft. The sauce should be thick and rich, and it should be very flavorful.

When tomatoes are out of season, there is no substitute for authentic San Marzano tomatoes. When tomatoes are in season, you can use any ripe tomatoes you can find. I like to use a mix of heirloom tomatoes and cherry tomatoes.

Here's a recipe for Amatriciana:

- 1 pound of pasta
- 1/2 cup of pecorino romano cheese
- 1/2 cup of freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 cup of guanciale
- 1/2 cup of olive oil
- 1/2 cup of pasta water
- 1/2 cup of tomatoes
