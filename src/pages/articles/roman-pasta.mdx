There are four traditional Roman pastas, each one a study in perfection through simplicity.

I have had the pleasure of visiting Rome a number of times. Each time I attempt to try more and more restaurants, each with their own approach to these four dishes.

It really is quite incredible how much variation you can find in dishes which are composed of just a few ingredients. There is no one secret to making them great,
but there are certainly some commonalities. Likewise, there are various pitfalls which are often repeated, especially in such a tourist heavy city where getting customers to come back
can be of lower priority.
